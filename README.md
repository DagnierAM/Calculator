# Calculator

TOP's caluclator project. 

My biggest project so far. This project will include HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript in order to make a functioning simple calculator with a nice UI.

I will use OOP for this project since I have some experience with PHP and Java previously and those concepts will be easier to use for me.
